 <button class="collapsible">As a first time home buyer, what do i need to know before signing an offer to purchase?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You should obtain adequate information about the property you get into buying or sign any offers to purchase. This information should include but not limited to:

Checking the amount of the annual property taxes and also finding out if there are any arrears in terms of taxes
Finding out if there are any restrictions on the title to the property
Equally important is checking with your bank and making sure that you are eligible for the mortgage financing amount that you will need</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Can I put condition on purchase? </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Yes, you may put conditions in the offer to purchase. Some of the common conditions include:

Obtaining required financing from your financial institute
Selling the house you are currently living in, if you own it
Obtaining a favourable report from building inspection personnel
Obtaining approval of your lawyer of the terms outlined in the offer</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">what is a mortgage?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>A mortgage is a charge on land created for securing a debt or loan. In other words, a bank or mortgage company lends you the money to buy your home and in turn you sign documents which are registered on the title to your home promising to repay them. If you default on your mortgage, the home will be repossessed to repay the loan, through a legal procedure called foreclosure.

</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">How do I go about getting a morgage?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Mortgage companies, banks, trust companies lend money in the form of mortgages. It is a good idea to start with your bank, as they will already be familiar with your credit rating and financial situation. However, do shop around for the best deal as it will offer options in terms of interest rates, payment options flexibility, and so on. At times, if you obtain a better deal elsewhere, your bank may be willing to match it.
You can also get a mortgage privately, from your parents for example, or anyone who is willing to lend money on the basis of a mortgage arrangement.
